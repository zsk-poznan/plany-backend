You want to have your timetable in raw format? Maybe you want to build custom timetable viewer? Or maybe you are writing a scripting that will display current classroom for your group? Then this is a place for you!

We want timetables to be easier to access and read! And thanks to that it can be displayed in shape that YOU want!

## API endpoints

### `/class/<class_id>.json`

Returns timetable for class

**class_id:** class identifier like `3e`, `1ga`; you need to use lower-case!

### `/room/<room_id>.json`

Returns timetable for all lessons in given classroom

**room_id:** room identifier like `21`, `b202`, `sg1`; you need to use lower-case!

### `/teacher/<teacher_id>.json`

Returns timetable for given teacher

**teacher_id:** teacher identifier like `ab`, `kz`; you need to use lower-case!

## How this works?

This API works by generating static json files. We parse html files generated by the Vulcan UONET+ and then after applying some data preprocessing we put it into json files.
